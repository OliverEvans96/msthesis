  A mathematical model is developed to describe the light field in
  vertical line seaweed cultivation in order to determine the
  degree to which the seaweed shades itself and limits the
  amount of light available for photosynthesis.
  A probabilistic description of the spatial distribution of kelp
  is formulated using simplifying assumptions about frond geometry and orientation.
  An integro-partial differential equation called the  radiative transfer equation
  is used to describe the light field as a function of position and angle.
  A finite difference solution is implemented, providing robustness and accuracy
  at a high computational cost, and
  an asymptotic approximation is subsequently developed for the case of low
  scattering which can achieve sufficient accuracy very quickly, and is
  suitable for use in a time-dependent dynamical kelp growth model
  under appropriate conditions.
