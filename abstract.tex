A probabilistic model for the spatial distribution of kelp fronds is developed
based on a kite-shaped geometry and simple assumptions about the motion of
fronds due to water velocity. Radiative transfer theory is then applied to
determine the radiation field by using the kelp model to determine optical
properties of the medium. Finite difference and asymptotic solutions are
explored, and behavior of the results over the parameter space is investigated.
Flume experiments with synthetic kelp, combined with optical measurements of
water and real kelp are used to determine model parameter values. Numerical
simulations to predict the lifetime biomass production of kelp plants are
performed to compare our light model to the previous exponential decay model. We
find that everything works exactly as planned and everyone lives happily ever
after.
