\chapter{THE TWO DIMENSIONAL WAVE EQUATION} \label{2DWaveEquation}

Here is an example of a 'section' and a few equations.

\section{Recurrence Relation}

A series solution for the two-dimensional wave equation
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{c^{2}}\frac{\partial^{2}u}{\partial t^{2}} = \frac{\partial^{2}u}{\partial r^{2}} + %
        \frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial u}{\partial r} + \frac{1}{r^{2}}\frac{\partial^{2}u}%
        {\partial\theta^{2}}                                                                 \label{waveEq}
\end{equation}
for outgoing waves is
\begin{equation}
u = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_{n}(\theta)f^{n}(r,t),                                              \label{Soln}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
f^{n} = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}r^{-k-\frac{1}{2}}f_{k}^{n}(ct-r).                                \label{function}
\end{equation} %look up reference.

You can reference a labeled equation by using the \textit{ref}
command.  For example, you can show that equations (\ref{Soln}) and
(\ref{function}) are a solution to equation (\ref{waveEq}).  (see the
file chap2.tex for the commands).
