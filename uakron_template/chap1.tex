\chapter{INTRODUCTION} \label{ch:intro}

The wave equation can be used to describe many physical phenomena.
Challenging topics in meteorology, acoustics, electro-magnetics, and
others involve solving the time-dependent wave equation.  Many of
these problems are described in an unbounded domain (i.e. there is no
boundary to reflect the outward traveling waves).  When an exact,
theoretical solution is unavailable, the lack of a boundary
prescription of accurate radiation conditions creates a problem for
numerical solutions.  The difficulty lies in is finding a way to do
calculations on an infinite domain using a computer with finite memory
in a finite amount of time and within a finite region.
