 Editing the file main.tex.

     As options to the \documentclass declaration
     you will include lot and lof for list of tables and list of figures (if
     you include tables and figures in you thesis), phd for a PhD
     dissertation style or ms for an MS style, and cpyr if you desire
     a copyright page.


     To generate the Title Page type in your thesis title in 
     \title{ }, your name in \author{ }, \conferraldate{month}{year} for the
     conferral date, \advisor{ }, \chair{ }, \collegedean{ },
     \gradschdean{ }, \coadvisor{ },\committee{ }.

     To include an abstract or acknowledgments page in your thesis
     you need to edit the abstract.tex file or respectively,
     acknowledgments.tex file.  If you do not desire an
     acknowledgments page remove the acknowledgments.tex file from
     your working directory.

     Input the chapters as separate tex files using the input command
     \input{chap1}, \input{chap2}, etc. For more chapters include
     more input statements. Each chapter is written in its file, for
     example your chapter 1 is written in the file chap1.tex.

     The \bibliography{bio} is a database your write and from which
     your bibliography will be generated. You will
     include all your references in the standard latex bibliography
     commands. See the example file bio.bib for examples..

     The \bibliographystyle{unsrt} is used to generate your
     bibliography. Run latex main.tex twice. Then run bibtex main.tex
     once, and then latex main.tex  twice. This generates
     the file main.dvi, which can be read using xdvi main.dvi. Please
     read the currently generated main.dvi for other hints.

    
     If you have n appendices, then use the \appendices{n} command
     followed by n \input{ ), just as is done for chapters.
