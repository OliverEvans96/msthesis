\chapter{EXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF PARAMETERS} \label{ch:experiment}

It looks like we probably won't be able to get the synthetic kelp to actually do
the experiments, but I'll describe what one would do in order to determine
``frond bending coefficients'', as well as optical properties of water and kelp,
citing literature and reporting values obtained by others.
