The photosynthetic tissue of this alga is exposed to a broad range of environmental factors, particularly related to light quantity and quality. In the present work, photosynthetic performance, light absorption, pigment composition, and thermal dissipation were measured in blades collected from different depths to characterize the photoacclimation and photoprotection responses of M. pyrifera according to the position of its photosynthetic tissue in the water column. The most important response of M. pyrifera was the enhancement of photoprotection in surface and near-surface blades. The size of the xanthophyll cycle pigment pool (XC) was correlated to the nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) of chl a fluorescence capacity of the blades. In surface blades, we detected the highest accumulation of UV-absorbing compounds, photoprotective carotenoids, ΣXC, and NPQ. These characteristics were important responses that allowed surface blades to present the highest maximum photosynthetic rate and the highest PSII electron transport rate. Therefore, surface blades made the highest contribution to algae production. In contrast, basal blades presented the opposite trend. These blades do not to contribute significantly to photosynthetate production of the whole organism, but they might be important for other functions, like nutrient uptake.},

	title = {Design of {Artificial} {Seaweeds} for {Assessment} of {Hydrodynamic} {Properties} of {Seaweed} {Farms}},
	url = {https://brage.bibsys.no/xmlui/handle/11250/2453424},
	abstract = {In recent years the prospect of having a seaweed industry in Norway has become of interest. Assessing the hydrodynamic properties of seaweed farms through experiments can help optimize
its design and thereby potential amount of biomass produced. However, there are difficulties associated with using seaweeds for experimental purposes, such as deterioration of the biological material when exposed to environments different from where they were harvested. Moreover, many facilities do not allow for biological material to be introduced. Consequently, to be able to assess hydrodynamic properties of seaweed farms, artificial seaweeds that accurately replicate important features of seaweed biomechanics and hydrodynamics are needed. It is important that the these properties are correctly reproduced on both blade and patch scale. 

The objective of this master thesis was to add to the knowledge of the hydrodynamics of seaweeds, more specifically Laminaria saccharina, the sugar kelp, to help future assessment of the hydrodynamic properties of seaweed farms. This was done by comparing drag force and behavior of two simplified blade morphologies, flat and undulate, both with uniform thickness. Even though seaweeds are subjected to both current and wave action, wave action was outside of the scope of this master thesis, and only steady, unidirectional flow was be considered. The experiments were conducted in the Marine Cybernetics laboratory at Department of Marine Technology at NTNU. The laboratory has equipment allowing for towing experiments. Two setups were use, one with only a profiled rod piercing the surface and one with a cylinder attached that allowed for dye to be distributed along its surface. The models were attached to the lower ends of the setups, and both blade and patch scale were considered. Two model sizes were tested for each simplified morphology. Due to high amounts of vibration and noise, the raw data was filtered before mean values and development of the drag force were presented. Underwater video footage allowed for some visual cues and behaviors to be observed and compared with the drag force.

The main finding of this master thesis, was that in contrary to the findings of Vettori (2016), flat blades do not seem to be a good representation of the undulate kelp L. saccharina. Agreeing with the findings of Paul and Henry (2014), it is likely that the models behave differently from the real seaweed due to different material density and therefore buoyancy. The reason for this conclusion can be seen from the video footage, showing that the models were behaving more similarly to a  bending  plant rather than a  tensile  plant at lower velocities. The Vogel exponent also had distinctly different behavior for the lower compared to higher velocities. These two regions of velocity could be found by looking at the angle between the flow and model. As L. saccharina has been shown to have near neutral buoyancy in water(Vettori, 2016), it is likely to behave as a  tensile  plant even at lower velocities, unlike the models tested.

From the findings in this master thesis, future development of an artificial seaweed model
for use as a surrogate of L. saccharina, should focus on models with undulate shape. Furthermore, to ease comparison with the hydrodynamic properties of the real seaweed, models should have the least amount of distorted parameters as possible. This to help uncover which parameters can be removed, and which are needed to correctly replicate important aspects of the seaweed hydrodynamics. In addition to looking at drag force, how the model influences the flow structure compared to the real seaweed should be examined. The reason for this being that oxygen and nutrient uptake are important factors to consider when optimizing seaweed farming.},

	abstract = {Recent years have seen a resurgence of interest in a variety of non-standard computational grids for global numerical prediction. The motivation has been to reduce problems associated with the converging meridians and the polar singularities of conventional regular latitude–longitude grids. A further impetus has come from the adoption of massively parallel computers, for which it is necessary to distribute work equitably across the processors; this is more practicable for some non-standard grids. Desirable attributes of a grid for high-order spatial ﬁnite differencing are: (i) geometrical regularity; (ii) a homogeneous and approximately isotropic spatial resolution; (iii) a low proportion of the grid points where the numerical procedures require special customization (such as near coordinate singularities or grid edges); (iv) ease of parallelization.},

	abstract = {The optical properties of case II coastal ocean waters are influenced by a complex mixture of seawater constituents and by a wide variety of physical processes. Especially in regions where formation of physical and optical fronts is frequent, but temporally and spatially variable, this complexity makes interpretation of ocean color signals subject to large uncertainty. The goal of our research is to determine which processes and optically important constituents must be considered to explain ocean color variations associated with coastal fronts on the New England continental shelf. To accomplish this goal we have implemented extensive time series sampling to support algorithm development and evaluation as a component of the NOPP-supported FRONT program. The FRONT study site is located at the mouth of Long Island Sound, an area strongly affected by estuarine outflow and tidal currents. Here we present inherent optical property (IOP) data collected with a WetLabs ac-9 absorption and attenuation meter from deployments of a custom designed mooring, the Autonomous Vertically Profiling Plankton Observatory (AVPPO). We developed a new method, which is independent of near infrared absorption measurements, to correct ac-9 absorption measurements for the effects of scattering. This new method has advantages because previous scattering correction approaches were limited by variability at near infrared wavelengths that cannot be explained by temperature and salinity corrections. Scattering corrected absorption spectra were decomposed into algal and non-algal fractions based on characteristic shapes of spectral absorption for the constituents. The strong relationship between scattering and the nonalgal absorption allowed the separation of absorption from Colored Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM) and from non-algal particles. We present distributions of absorption by these bio-optically important constituents (phytoplankton, non-algal particles, and CDOM). Optical constituents varied with tidal, seasonal, and external forcing. Diurnal variation was also evident in phytoplankton optical properties in surface waters.},

The attenuation coefficient (Kd) was found to vary significantly during the year. The highest Kd values were obtained in the station with higher influence of currents and run-off. Our data suggested a reflection of 50\% of light that reaches the bottom, which is associated with a decrease in the Kd value obtained with the spherical sensor of 0.15 m-1. This means that flat sensors may underestimate PAR and that spherical sensor may underestimate Kd. This is a critical issue given that knowledge on light attenuation is essential for modeling approaches and quality assessments.},
