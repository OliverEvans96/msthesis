	abstract = {We present a numerical implementation of radiative transfer based on an explicitly photon-conserving advection scheme, where radiative fluxes over the cell interfaces of a structured or unstructured mesh are calculated with a second-order reconstruction of the intensity field. The approach employs a direct discretisation of the radiative transfer equation in Boltzmann form with adjustable angular resolution that in principle works equally well in the optically thin and optically thick regimes. In our most general formulation of the scheme, the local radiation field is decomposed into a linear sum of directional bins of equal solid-angle, tessellating the unit sphere. Each of these "cone-fields" is transported independently, with constant intensity as a function of direction within the cone. Photons propagate at the speed of light (or optionally using a reduced speed of light approximation to allow larger timesteps), yielding a fully time-dependent solution of the radiative transfer equation that can naturally cope with an arbitrary number of sources, as well as with scattering. The method casts sharp shadows, subject to the limitations induced by the adopted angular resolution. If the number of point sources is small and scattering is unimportant, our implementation can alternatively treat each source exactly in angular space, producing shadows whose sharpness is only limited by the grid resolution. A third hybrid alternative is to treat only a small number of the locally most luminous point sources explicitly, with the rest of the radiation intensity followed in a radiative diffusion approximation. We have implemented the method in the moving-mesh code \{{\textbackslash}small AREPO\}, where it is coupled to the hydrodynamics in an operator splitting approach that subcycles the radiative transfer alternatingly with the hydrodynamical evolution steps.},

The photosynthetic tissue of this alga is exposed to a broad range of environmental factors, particularly related to light quantity and quality. In the present work, photosynthetic performance, light absorption, pigment composition, and thermal dissipation were measured in blades collected from different depths to characterize the photoacclimation and photoprotection responses of M. pyrifera according to the position of its photosynthetic tissue in the water column. The most important response of M. pyrifera was the enhancement of photoprotection in surface and near-surface blades. The size of the xanthophyll cycle pigment pool (XC) was correlated to the nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) of chl a fluorescence capacity of the blades. In surface blades, we detected the highest accumulation of UV-absorbing compounds, photoprotective carotenoids, ΣXC, and NPQ. These characteristics were important responses that allowed surface blades to present the highest maximum photosynthetic rate and the highest PSII electron transport rate. Therefore, surface blades made the highest contribution to algae production. In contrast, basal blades presented the opposite trend. These blades do not to contribute significantly to photosynthetate production of the whole organism, but they might be important for other functions, like nutrient uptake.},

	title = {Design of {Artificial} {Seaweeds} for {Assessment} of {Hydrodynamic} {Properties} of {Seaweed} {Farms}},
	url = {https://brage.bibsys.no/xmlui/handle/11250/2453424},
	abstract = {In recent years the prospect of having a seaweed industry in Norway has become of interest. Assessing the hydrodynamic properties of seaweed farms through experiments can help optimize
its design and thereby potential amount of biomass produced. However, there are difficulties associated with using seaweeds for experimental purposes, such as deterioration of the biological material when exposed to environments different from where they were harvested. Moreover, many facilities do not allow for biological material to be introduced. Consequently, to be able to assess hydrodynamic properties of seaweed farms, artificial seaweeds that accurately replicate important features of seaweed biomechanics and hydrodynamics are needed. It is important that the these properties are correctly reproduced on both blade and patch scale. 

The objective of this master thesis was to add to the knowledge of the hydrodynamics of seaweeds, more specifically Laminaria saccharina, the sugar kelp, to help future assessment of the hydrodynamic properties of seaweed farms. This was done by comparing drag force and behavior of two simplified blade morphologies, flat and undulate, both with uniform thickness. Even though seaweeds are subjected to both current and wave action, wave action was outside of the scope of this master thesis, and only steady, unidirectional flow was be considered. The experiments were conducted in the Marine Cybernetics laboratory at Department of Marine Technology at NTNU. The laboratory has equipment allowing for towing experiments. Two setups were use, one with only a profiled rod piercing the surface and one with a cylinder attached that allowed for dye to be distributed along its surface. The models were attached to the lower ends of the setups, and both blade and patch scale were considered. Two model sizes were tested for each simplified morphology. Due to high amounts of vibration and noise, the raw data was filtered before mean values and development of the drag force were presented. Underwater video footage allowed for some visual cues and behaviors to be observed and compared with the drag force.

The main finding of this master thesis, was that in contrary to the findings of Vettori (2016), flat blades do not seem to be a good representation of the undulate kelp L. saccharina. Agreeing with the findings of Paul and Henry (2014), it is likely that the models behave differently from the real seaweed due to different material density and therefore buoyancy. The reason for this conclusion can be seen from the video footage, showing that the models were behaving more similarly to a  bending  plant rather than a  tensile  plant at lower velocities. The Vogel exponent also had distinctly different behavior for the lower compared to higher velocities. These two regions of velocity could be found by looking at the angle between the flow and model. As L. saccharina has been shown to have near neutral buoyancy in water(Vettori, 2016), it is likely to behave as a  tensile  plant even at lower velocities, unlike the models tested.

From the findings in this master thesis, future development of an artificial seaweed model
for use as a surrogate of L. saccharina, should focus on models with undulate shape. Furthermore, to ease comparison with the hydrodynamic properties of the real seaweed, models should have the least amount of distorted parameters as possible. This to help uncover which parameters can be removed, and which are needed to correctly replicate important aspects of the seaweed hydrodynamics. In addition to looking at drag force, how the model influences the flow structure compared to the real seaweed should be examined. The reason for this being that oxygen and nutrient uptake are important factors to consider when optimizing seaweed farming.},

	abstract = {This paper studies numerical integration over the unit sphere \$ {\textbackslash}mathbb\{S\}{\textasciicircum}2 {\textbackslash}subset {\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}\{3\} \$ by using spherical \$t\$-design, which is an equal positive weights quadrature rule with polynomial precision \$t\$. We investigate two kinds of spherical \$t\$-designs with \$t\$ up to 160. One is well conditioned spherical \$t\$-design(WSTD), which was proposed by [1] with \$ N=(t+1){\textasciicircum}\{2\} \$. The other is efficient spherical \$t\$-design(ESTD), given by Womersley [2], which is made of roughly of half cardinality of WSTD. Consequently, a series of persuasive numerical evidences indicates that WSTD is better than ESTD in the sense of worst-case error in Sobolev space \$ {\textbackslash}mathbb\{H\}{\textasciicircum}\{s\}({\textbackslash}mathbb\{S\}{\textasciicircum}2) \$. Furthermore, WSTD is employed to approximate integrals of various of functions, especially including integrand has a point singularity over the unit sphere and a given ellipsoid. In particular, to deal with singularity of integrand, Atkinson's transformation [3] and Sidi's transformation [4] are implemented with the choices of `grading parameters' to obtain new integrand which is much smoother. Finally, the paper presents numerical results on uniform errors for approximating representive integrals over sphere with three quadrature rules: Bivariate trapezoidal rule, Equal area points and WSTD.},

The motivation has been to reduce problems associated with the converging meridians and the polar singularities of conventional regular latitude–longitude grids. A further impetus has come from the adoption of massively parallel computers, for which it is necessary to distribute work equitably across the processors; this is more practicable for some non-standard grids. Desirable attributes of a grid for high-order spatial ﬁnite differencing are: (i) geometrical regularity; (ii) a homogeneous and approximately isotropic spatial resolution; (iii) a low proportion of the grid points where the numerical procedures require special customization (such as near coordinate singularities or grid edges); (iv) ease of parallelization.},

	title = {Inherent {Optical} {Properties} in {New} {England} {Coastal} {Waters}: {Decomposition} into {Contributions} from {Optically} {Important} {Constituents}},
	abstract = {The optical properties of case II coastal ocean waters are influenced by a complex mixture of seawater constituents and by a wide variety of physical processes. Especially in regions where formation of physical and optical fronts is frequent, but temporally and spatially variable, this complexity makes interpretation of ocean color signals subject to large uncertainty. The goal of our research is to determine which processes and optically important constituents must be considered to explain ocean color variations associated with coastal fronts on the New England continental shelf. To accomplish this goal we have implemented extensive time series sampling to support algorithm development and evaluation as a component of the NOPP-supported FRONT program. The FRONT study site is located at the mouth of Long Island Sound, an area strongly affected by estuarine outflow and tidal currents. Here we present inherent optical property (IOP) data collected with a WetLabs ac-9 absorption and attenuation meter from deployments of a custom designed mooring, the Autonomous Vertically Profiling Plankton Observatory (AVPPO). We developed a new method, which is independent of near infrared absorption measurements, to correct ac-9 absorption measurements for the effects of scattering. This new method has advantages because previous scattering correction approaches were limited by variability at near infrared wavelengths that cannot be explained by temperature and salinity corrections. Scattering corrected absorption spectra were decomposed into algal and non-algal fractions based on characteristic shapes of spectral absorption for the constituents. The strong relationship between scattering and the nonalgal absorption allowed the separation of absorption from Colored Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM) and from non-algal particles. We present distributions of absorption by these bio-optically important constituents (phytoplankton, non-algal particles, and CDOM). Optical constituents varied with tidal, seasonal, and external forcing. Diurnal variation was also evident in phytoplankton optical properties in surface waters.},

The attenuation coefficient (Kd) was found to vary significantly during the year. The highest Kd values were obtained in the station with higher influence of currents and run-off. Our data suggested a reflection of 50\% of light that reaches the bottom, which is associated with a decrease in the Kd value obtained with the spherical sensor of 0.15 m-1. This means that flat sensors may underestimate PAR and that spherical sensor may underestimate Kd. This is a critical issue given that knowledge on light attenuation is essential for modeling approaches and quality assessments.},

	abstract = {Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) is being explored on both economic and environmental grounds in many traditional aquaculture regions. To test a variety of suitable macroalgae species and management scenarios, a numerical model is developed to quantify the remediation of dissolved nutrients and production of macroalgae near a nutrient source. Differences in the morphological, physiological, and economic characteristics of different macroalgae species can provide flexibility when considering the cost and benefit of farming macroalgae. Results show that of the three species studied, Macrocystis pyrifera removed 75 \% of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) input from a point source, while Porphyra umbilicalis and Ulva lactuca removed 5 \%. Both M. pyrifera and P. umbilicalis have reduced bioremediation capacity at increasing flow rates. U. lactuca showed increased bioremediation potential as flow rate increased from low to moderate flows. Increasing the optical depth increased the bioremediation potential of M. pyrifera for moderate values of the light attenuation coefficient, whereas bioremediation was unaffected by optical depth for both U. lactuca and P. umbilicalis. Harvesting increased bioremediation capacity of all species by up to 25-fold dependent on the establishment phase and harvesting frequency. We conclude that the choice of macroalgae species greatly affects the success of IMTA and that both harvesting and farm arrangements can be used to greatly optimize bioremediation.},

Environmental considerations will increasingly determine product and process acceptability and drive the next generation of economic opportunity. Some countries, including Japan, are actively promoting "green" technologies that will be in demand worldwide in the coming decades. Should an international agreement on CO2-reduction be ratified, its effective use for energy production would be of high priority. This report shows that macroalgae have great potential for biomass production and CO2 bioremediation. Macroalgae have high productivity, as great or greater than the most productive land plants, and do not compete with terrestrial crops for farm land. The review focuses on recent data on productivity, photosynthesis, nutrient dynamics, optimization and economics. Biomass from macroalgae promises to provide environmentally and economically feasible alternatives to fossil fuels. Nevertheless, the techniques and technologies for growing macroalgae on a large-scale and for converting feedstocks to energy carriers must be more fully developed.},

A simple alternative to this is use of biofilters to reduce the nutrient load. Hence, the marine macroalgae Caulerpa taxifolia (biosorpent) was screened for its nutrients and heavy metal absorption capacities at various initial concentrations and contact period in laboratory conditions. Likewise, the red alga Kappaphycus alvarezii was tested for nutrient utilization besides its growth in waste water. The experiment on nutrient absorption by seaweed C. taxifolia inferred that all time intervals (6, 12, 18 and 24 hrs) maintained at different pH (4-10) in the present study showed significant amount of nutrients absorption. Of these, 24 hours biosorption at pH 7 showed the utmost removal of all the tested nutrients. The maximum absorption of zinc was recorded in pH 7 and at 24 hours with 0.5 g concentration of the seaweed being optimum under laboratory conditions. The experimental study using K.alvarezii in shrimp waste water confirmed excellent potentials of the seaweed in absorbing nutrients and thereby aiding its growth.},

The estimates of nitrogen (N) removal by Gracilaria over a 90-day growing season were up to 28 and 94 kg N ha−1 at the LIS and BRE sites, respectively. In July 2012, Gracilaria grew up to 16.5\% day−1 at BRE and 4.8\% day−1 at the LIS site. Tissue N contents at the same periods were 3.7\% (BRE) and 1.5\% (LIS), respectively. These results demonstrate rapid assimilation of nutrients fueling the growth of new Gracilaria tissue at the BRE site, while nutrients appeared to limit growth at the LIS site during the summer months. The estimated C removal by Gracilaria at the BRE and LIS sites were up to 300 kg ha−1 (LIS) and 727 kg ha−1 (BRE), respectively. The potential economic values of N and C sequestration for the period examined in this study were as high as \$311 (LIS) and \$940 ha−1 (BRE) for N, and \$5.51 (LIS) and \$13.32 ha−1 (BRE) for C if seaweed aquaculture would be included in Connecticut's Nitrogen Trading Program. This represents a potential additional economic incentive for seaweed growers, beyond the direct value of seaweed products. The ﬁndings in this study showed that seaweed (Gracilaria) aquaculture can be a useful technique for nutrient bioextraction in urbanized coastal waters, such as the estuaries of New York City (BRE) and Long Island Sound.},

A previously developed model for the frond size and composition (carbon and nitrogen content) of S. latissima sporophytes was adjusted to data from an outdoor mesocosm growth experiment and then coupled and run online with the 3-dimensional model system. Results from simulations were compared with data from an IMTA field experiment, providing partial validation of the hydrodynamic–ecological–kelp model system. The model system was applied to study the large-scale cultivation potential of S. latissima in IMTA with salmon and to quantify its seasonal bioremediation potential. The results suggest a possible yield of 75 t fresh weight S. latissima ha−1 in 4 mo (February to June) and about 170 t fresh weight ha−1 in 10 mo (August to June). The results further suggest that the net nitrogen consumption of a 1 ha S. latissima installation in the vicinity of a fish farm producing approximately 5000 t salmon in a production cycle is about 0.36 (0.15) t NH4+-N, or a removal of 0.34\% (0.41\%) of the dissolved inorganic nitrogen effluent with a cultivation period from August (February) to June. Due to the differing seasonal growth patterns of fish and kelp, there was a mismatch between the maximum effluent of NH4+-N from the fish farm and the maximum uptake rates in S. latissima.},

Given the continued increase in CFD related publications, and the many significant advancements in computational techniques and computer technology, it has become necessary to revisit the issue and formulate a more detailed policy to further improve the quality of publications in this area. This brief note provides specific guidelines for prospective authors for calculation and reporting of discretization error estimates in CFD simulations where experimental data may or may not be available for comparison. The underlying perspective is that CFD-related studies will eventually aim to predict the outcome of a physical event for which experimental data is not available. It should be emphasized that the requirements outlined in this note do not preclude those already published in the previous two policy statements. It is also important to keep in mind that the procedure recommended in this note cannot possibly encompass all possible scenarios or applications.},

	abstract = {The problem of numerically integrating general elliptic differential equations in irregular two and three dimensional regions is discussed. The method used numerically computes a transformation of the given region into a rectangular region. The numerical coordinate transformation is determined by requiring that the components of the transformation satisfy inhomogeneous Laplace or more general equations. The transformation is then used to transform the differential equation and the boundary conditions to the rectangular region. The boundary value problem in the rectangular region is integrated using one of the standard methods for general elliptic equations. The use of the existing software reduces the problem to analytically transforming the given differential equation and the Laplacian to general coordinate frame and then writing subroutines that will tabulate the coefficients of these differential equations using the tabulated coordinate transformation. This method has been successfully used in two dimensions so we are concerned with the three dimensional extension of the existing codes where the major problem encountered is the volume of algebra and coding required to complete the method. To overcome these difficulties, a symbol manipulation program in VAXIMA is written that has as input the formula for the given differential equation in some natural coordinates and has as output the required FORTRAN subroutines. Because of the complexity of the resulting code, code validation was performed by systematic truncation error testing. The paper concludes with a discussion of the problems encountered in using a symbol manipulator to write large FORTRAN codes.},

	abstract = {The present study reports a numerical procedure based on a series of tests that make use of the method of manufactured solutions (MMS) and allow to evaluate the effective numerical performance with respect to the theoretical order of accuracy. The method is applied to a pressure-based finite volume numerical scheme suited to variable density flows representative of those encountered in combustion applications. The algorithm is based on a predictor–corrector time integration scheme that employs a projection method for the momentum equations. A physically consistent constraint is retained to ensure that the velocity field is solved correctly. The MMS application shows that the combination of this velocity constraint and the variable-coefficient Poisson solver is of fundamental importance to ensure both the numerical stability and the expected order of accuracy. Especially, the resort to an inner iteration procedure gives rise to undeniable improvements in terms of both the order of accuracy and error magnitude. The MMS applications confirm the interest of the method to conduct a preliminary check of the performance of any numerical algorithm applied to both fully incompressible and variable density flows. Finally, the analysis is ended by the application of the retained pressure-based finite-volume scheme to the numerical simulation of mixing layers featuring increasing values of the density contrast. The corresponding results shed some light onto the stability and robustness of the numerical scheme, important issues that are not addressed through MMS analyses.},

	abstract = {Numerical modelling of wide ranges of different physical scales, which are involved in Shallow Water (SW) problems, has been a key challenge in computational hydraulics. Adaptive meshing techniques have been commonly coupled with numerical methods in an attempt to address this challenge. The combination of MultiWavelets (MW) with the Runge–Kutta Discontinuous Galerkin (RKDG) method offers a new philosophy to readily achieve mesh adaptivity driven by the local variability of the numerical solution, and without requiring more than one threshold value set by the user. However, the practical merits and implications of the MWRKDG, in terms of how far it contributes to address the key challenge above, are yet to be explored. This work systematically explores this, through the verification and validation of the MWRKDG for selected steady and transient benchmark tests, which involves the features of real SW problems. Our findings reveal a practical promise of the SW-MWRKDG solver, in terms of efficient and accurate mesh-adaptivity, but also suggest further improvement in the SW-RKDG reference scheme to better intertwine with, and harness the prowess of, the MW-based adaptivity.},

	abstract = {We report on the verification of a three-dimensional unstructured finite element method applicable to compressible fluid dynamics and diffusion problems. Our verification methodology uses a combination of analytic and manufactured solutions to formally measure convergence rates in global error for both shock-dominated flows and smooth problems. In addition we measure the global error in vorticity, which should converge at reduced-order relative to the velocity solution. The numerical method under investigation is an edge-based Finite Element formulation on linear tetrahedra with a parabolic MUSCL reconstruction for the advective fluxes. The scheme is nominally second-order accurate on smooth flows. For diffusion problems the formulation also is nominally second-order accurate. Using global error analysis we measure convergence rates of 0.8–1.0 for shock-dominated problems and 1.5–2.4 for smooth problems. Calculations with Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) are observed to produce errors comparable to finer mesh simulations but at significantly reduced computational cost. A convergence rate of 2.2 also is observed for a simplified diffusion problem. Examples of how these studies can inform simulation practices are provided.},

Various problems concerning infinitely many, infinitely small, parts, had been solved before the infinitesimal calculus was invented; for example, Archimedes on the circumference of the circle. The essence of the invention of the calculus appears to be that the passage to the limit was thereby taken at the earliest possible stage, where diverse problems had operations like d/dx in common. Although the infinitesimal calculus has been a splendid success, yet there remain problems in which it is cumbrous or unworkable. When such difficulties are encountered it may be well to return to the manner in which they did things before the calculus was invented, postponing the passage to the limit until after the problem had been solved for a moderate number of moderately small differences. For obtaining the solution of the difference-problem a variety of arithmetical processes are available. This memoir deals with central differences arranged in the simplest possible way, namely, that explained by the writer in the papers cited in the footnote. Advancing differences are ignored, and so are the varieties of central-difference-process in which accuracy is gained by complicating the arithmetic at an early stage.},

The model appears to reproduce the space and time (F 1 week and 10 nautical miles) distribution of suspended biomass well, but it underestimates vertical export of carbon at depth. The modelled primary production ranges from 79 to 118 g C mÀ 2 yearÀ 1 (average 93 g C mÀ 2 yearÀ 1) between 4 different years with higher variability in the ice-covered Arctic (F 26\%) than in the Atlantic (F 7\%) section. Meteorological forcing has a strong impact on the vertical stratification of the regions dominated by Atlantic water and this results in significant differences in seasonal variability in primary production.
