We present a probabilistic model for the spatial distribution of kelp, and develop a first-principles model for the light field, considering absorption and scattering due to the water and kelp.
A full finite difference solution is presented, and an asymptotic approximation based on discrete scattering events is subsequently developed.
The asymptotic approximation is shown to converge to the finite difference solution in cases where the absorption coefficient is the same order
of magnitude as the scattering coefficient or larger.
Otherwise, the solution diverges.

Many aspects of the model have room for future improvement.
The most pressing is probably the development of a model for long-lines, which
is more popular in practice than the vertical lines studied here.
Similar techniques can likely be applied, but the details will of course differ.

One major simplification in the calculation of the kelp model
is the assumption that the fronds are perfectly horizontal.
This could be improved in a straightforward way by including some
probability distribution for the angular elevation as a function of current speed,
similar to the study performed in \citep{norvik_design_2017}.
The cost of implementing polar rotation is that depth layers are no longer isolated.
Rather than integrating the two dimensional length-orientation distribution from
Section \ref{sec:dist_2d} to calculate the spatial kelp distribution,
it would be necessary to perform a triple integral which includes the elevation distribution.
Since frond elevation and azimuathal orientation are both related to current velocity,
it would likely be impossible to ignore the remarks at the end of \ref{sec:dist_2d}, and the
assumption of independent distributions would have to be abandoned.

Of course, real fronds are not rotating planar kites, but have a very dynamic geometry.
To consider out-of-plane frond bending would require a totally different approach.
Whether or not any improved description of the seaweed would merit the substantial work is unclear.
