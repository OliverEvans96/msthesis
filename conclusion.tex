% TODO: Write this
We present a probabilistic model for the spatial distribution of kelp, and develop a first-principles model for the light field, considering absorption and scattering due to the water and kelp.
A full finite difference solution is presented, and an asymptotic approximation based on discrete scattering events is subsequently developed.

Future work:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Frond bending
  \item Horizontal kelp ropes (long lines)
  \item etc.
  %TODO: Add more
\end{itemize}
