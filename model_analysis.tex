\section{Grid Study}
Run many grid sizes with GMRES, using asymptotic solution as initial guess.
Compare CPU times and accuracy, assuming largest grid is ``true'' solution.
Determine necessary grid size to achieve reasonable accuracy.

\section{Asymptotics vs. Finite Difference}
Compare asymptotic solutions to GMRES with reasonable grid size as determined
above. Compare CPU time and accuracy. Determine ideal number of scatters to
include (number of terms in asymptotic series). Repeat for a few values of
scattering coefficient.

\section{Parameter Study}
Vary parameters and measure average differences in radiance for full grid, as
well as average irradance over depth.

- absorption coefficient

- scattering coefficient

- VSF

- frond bending coefficient
