To include figures side-by-side use the minipage environment.

\begin{figure}[ht]

See chap4.tex for the commands used to build the table and figure.  As
you add chapters, figures, and tables, the table of contents and lists
will automatically be updated.

Figure~\ref{sbys} is an example of figures side-by-side, with
Figure~\ref{sbys}A to the left of \ref{sbys}B.
